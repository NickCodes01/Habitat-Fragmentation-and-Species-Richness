# Habitat-Fragmentation-and-Species-Richness

Utilized satellite data and advanced image analysis tools, like ImageJ, to investigate the influence of habitat elements on plant species richness and abundance within a given area.
Performed statistical analysis and spatial modeling to identify correlations between habitat fragmentation metrics and biodiversity indices, providing practical findings for conservation efforts on campus.
